** Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) ** death of motor neurone in the brain and spinal cord result in loss of mobility,
 dexterity , speech and ability to swallow.
** FrontoTemporal Dementia (FTD) ** Meurons from frontal and temporal lobe of the brain die, leading to range of 
cognitive and behavioural diseases.

In both disease range of RNA binding proteins TDP-43 build up.  
Mutation in the gene C9orf72 is a peculiar gene – its name literally stands for the 72nd open reading frame on chromosome 9 – 
and the disease-causing mutation is even stranger.

One of the gene's introns normally contains between two and 23 repeats of a six-nucleotide segment (GGGGCC), 
but this number can rise to hundreds (or even thousands) in the mutant gene.
This increase in repeat numbers could cause disease in several ways:
 the repeated segments could, for example, be transcribed into RNA molecules that soak up 
 RNA-binding proteins and prevent these proteins from carrying out their functions.

However, when measuring the mRNA targets of TDP-43, it appeared that TDP-43 had lost much more of its function in
 the samples with the splicing signature that matches the C9orf72 mutation carriers. The insolubility of TDP-43 
 (how it behaves biochemically) was therefore more important to identify the two groups.
support the idea that the splicing defects found in ALS and FTD appear when any of several RNA-binding 
proteins becomes insoluble. 

Their model predicts the existence of an equilibrium between an array of RNA-binding proteins, 
each at a different concentration and in a physically distinct state.
