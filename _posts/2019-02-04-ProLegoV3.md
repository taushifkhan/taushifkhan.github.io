## ProLego : 

Most of us in our childhood loved building with blocks. With the use of small 
components, we make amazing structured forms that may or may not make sense. But more importantly, 
it challenges the brain and made us more creative.

Proteins are functional/structural modules of cell. The diversity in protein structure 
and function has been sculpted by evolution by use of bio-physical forces. However, we know
different level of organisation principles in protein structures as put-forward by SCOP and CATH, 
the smallest module is yet to be known. 

The polypeptide chain is mostly formed of 20 amino acids, which (self-)organised and assembled
to form secondary-structures(SS : helix, strands) by Hydrogen bonding. 
These SS organised into specific order (topology) resulting in function specific 3D structure.

> Topological representation of protein chain (1JB0, chain L) using ProteinLego server (1)

With [ProLego](www.proteinlego.com) (or Protein as Lego like blocks), we provide a data-driven library of structural modules. 
These modules are evaluated from secondary structure arrangements and contacts from curated set of representative
protein dataset of all known structures from [Protein Data Bank](www.pdb.org). 

## Contact String or Topology representation:

Protein contact map (i.e. 2x2 matrix), represents all residue pair that are in certain spatial
proximity. Definition of proximity has been evaluated by number of studies as reported in
[Khan-2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25669306). However, certain contacts like centacts between 
residues that are in SS are more conserved and signatory for certain topology then that are in loop or 
unstructured regions. Considering this well accepted hypothesis, we have constructed a
1D linear string that encrypts the crucial topological behavior of a protein chain.


ProLego can extract this topological string from a given protein chain. Inputs to the server
can be protein id from PDB, or a well-formatted PDB chain file. Once, the protein chain in 
query meet all required parameters (main criteria as minimum number of SS >=3 ), the server will 
generate 1D contact /topology string.


## ProLego Database

* [ProLegoDB](http://www.proteinlego.com/proLegoDB/) 

This is a collection of all topology from representative protein chains from PDB. 
The representative set has been generated from [PISCES server](http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/PISCES.php). In addition to protein
chains, protein domains are also considered for generating topology database for ProLego. We have used CATH v.4.1. and SCOP v.1.75,
with representative cluster of 40% sequence identity.


## Topology Visualisation

Visualisation is not only a treat to eyes but provide us abstract idea of complex nature of problem. Now a days with increasing 
prevalence of JavaScript, we have number of options /library that can be used for generating desired illustration. I will cover this
in a different post. 

We have used [D3-library](https://d3js.org/) to represent protein topology by parsing generated topology string.

## Example

* Pdb Id: 2XZ2, chain A
* Molecule : CSTF-50

A 3 helical 66 reside protein chain, shows a contact string of [Ha.0-Hr](http://www.proteinlego.com/prot/984/) . 
This represents that Helix 1 -- Helix 2 and Helix 1 -- Helix 3 are in contact. The orientation of contacts are repented as 
"anti-parallel" (a) and "orthogonal" (r) respectively. 

Three types of visualisation ,
   1. as SS contact map
   2. Linear Topology Graph
   3. 2D topology graph
are generated using JavaScriot and contact string.

A search of topology string to ProLegoDB shows three interesting results:

* Proteins with Identical Topology: In the ProLegoDB there are 4 pdb chains with same topology as that of query.
* Protein with similar Topology (same scaffold: Same secondary structure composition and contact-pair but of different orientation): 
    There are 19 such protein chain.
* Proteins with topologies of same secondary structure (H/E) component
  (Topologies with same secondary structure composition with different contact-pairs and orientation):
    There are 299 such protein chain. This is all protein chain with same number of secondary structure i.e. 3 helix.

## mode of usage

1. server : go to [www.proteinlego.com](www.proteinlego.com). The server is well documented for usage and interpretation of results.
2. OffLine : clone repository 
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/taushifkhan/ProLego4.git
    ```
