### About Me
Professionally I defined myself as computational biologist. I have a doctoral degree and 2+ 
years of research experience in computational study of protein structures (by Jan 2019). 
By solving computationally challenges in I am inspired to dig more to unravel the mysteries
of life.

Apart from research, I am interested in politics, history (formation of civilization) and good stories.
Presently, I am in Brussels, Belgium. 
 

###  Research Interest

The complexity in life forms and its components are driven by eloquent designing and
regulation principles. My research focuses on investigating the underlying orders of
biomolecules particularly protein structures. 

## Experience

*   **[2016 to -]** Post-Doctoral Research,
    *  Location : Interuniversity Institute of Bioinformatics in Brussels,
    *  Project Title: FoldMod: The role of local amino acid interactions in protein folding, 
    fold stability and the location of post-translational modifications.
    
* **[2010 to 2016]** Doctoral Research
    * Location : Jawaharlal Nehru University
    * Thesis: "Understanding variation in Protein Topology Using Structure & Simulation"
    * Advisor Prof. Indira Ghosh, SCIS, JNU).
    * **Key Points**
    􏰂   * Development of topology representation for protein 3-Dimensional structure.
    􏰂   * Development of protein topology visualization and topology database server
    􏰂   * Identifying "Emergent structure modularity" in protein topology
    􏰂   * Addressing the relationship between protein folding kinetics with 
        structure topological preference using struture based models and simulation.
