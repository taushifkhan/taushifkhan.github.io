### About Me
Professionally I defined myself as computational biologist. I have a doctoral degree and 2+ 
years of research experience in computational study of protein structures (by Jan 2019). 
By solving computationally challenges in I am inspired to dig more to unravel the mysteries
of life.

Apart from research, I am interested in politics, history (formation of civilization) and good stories.
Presently, I am in Brussels, Belgium. 
 

###  Research Interest

The complexity in life forms and its components are driven by eloquent designing and
regulation principles. My research focuses on investigating the underlying orders of
bio-molecules particularly protein structures.
